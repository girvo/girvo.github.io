  I'm an ex-junkie, ex-drug dealer; I'm someone who is not quite your average
  twenty-two year old (unless the ones you hang around have chemical dependencies
  and a death wish, anyway). When you're a part of the underbelly of a city,
  you end up with some rather <em>interesting</em> stories. I've decided to
  share them with you. Check out a <a href="//jgirvin.com/the-things-we-do.html">draft chapter
  here</a>, to see what you're getting into, and I'm getting out of.

  times daily, 5 if needed. 100mg minimum should do the trick I think"

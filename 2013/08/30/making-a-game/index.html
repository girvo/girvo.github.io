<p>I have an idea. It’s an idea I’ve been working on for quite a while now, and it is beginning to take shape, but I don’t think I am allowed to bring my idea to life. Now that sounds weird, right? Censorship isn’t something we are usually okay with, as a free society, and yet in the games industry, it’s par for the course.</p>

<p>Picture this: a first-person shooter-slash-adventure game, based in a city. So far, so sort-of-GTA, right? Here’s the kicker: it’s about drug addiction, the underbelly of society and what it’s like to be dragged kicking and screaming down into it.</p>

<h2 id="the_game">The Game</h2>

<p>This is not a game that glorifies drugs. This is not a game where shooting up some speed makes you “faster”, or morphine giving you more health. This is a game where you must made ends meet, make terrible decisions to feed your addiction or face the horrible withdrawals, and the wrath of the Association – deal drugs, or very bad things happen to people you love. It’s dark, it’s gloomy, it’s going to be hard to play through. It won’t have a happy ending. It’s a real life rendition of what those situations are actually like.</p>

<h2 id="the_problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>But I am not allowed to make it. Well, okay, I am, as an indie PC game perhaps, but if I wanted to put it on Steam? If I wanted to put it on the upcoming PS4? I can’t. Drugs, even if they are handled this way, are off limits, but screwing a hooker and murdering her (GTA)? Mowing down civilians (in a frankly unaffecting scene from Modern Warfare 2)? These are fine, but a realistic portrayl of drug dealing and the horrors that surround the scene, that is not.</p>

<p>I cannot understand societies take on this. For the record, I’m against the war on drugs; half the things I want to delve into in this game are caused by it directly. But I am not allowed to tackle this issue, if I want to see success? This is not going to just be an “issue” game: I want it to be gripping, exciting, and a massively memorable experience. I want it to be a good game. But I also want to say something: and I’m not allowed.</p>

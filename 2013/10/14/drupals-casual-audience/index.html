<p>First, a confession: I <em>like</em> PHP. Really, I do. I’m sure you’ve all seen the infamous “A Fractal Of Bad Design” article, and while a lot of the gripes have a decent basis in fact, a lot of it really just doesn’t matter in the day to day. With the release of PHP 5.4, the rapid adoption of Composer, the amazing site <a href="http://packagist.org">Packagist</a>, and the RFC process finally picking up some awesome features (that may be late, but at least they are here): PHP is growing up.</p>

<p>This is a good thing. It’s a language that has been (fairly, and unfairly) derided over the years for various reasons, but despite all the technical and philosophical whinging is still one of the most used (if not <em>the</em> most used) languages for Web Development out there. One of the key reasons for this is the “CMS” <strong>Drupal</strong>. You’ve likely come across it if you’ve done any sort of web development over the past 5 years or so. It’s a huge project, that allows those without a BCompSci degree to whip up great (and complex, if need be) dynamic websites in a rapid timescale.</p>

<p>The thing is, Drupal hasn’t ever been the pincale of “best practices”. Relying on it’s… <em>interesting</em> “module” system, lots of global variables, “hooks” and other curious design choices, it was very much a product of it’s time. However, for a lot of the users of Drupal itself this didn’t matter: they could learn enough PHP to get by, and hack up what is needed (similar to how WordPress development by users goes, actually) to get it to work. As an aside, for myself I struggled with it; coming from a more “traditional” development background, focused on good seperation of concerns and DRY patterns, I really struggled to wrap my head around it.</p>

<p>With the upcoming Drupal 8 however, this is changing. There is only about 25% lines of code left that are original “Drupal” core code. They’ve embraced Composer, PSR-0, and the Symfony components (which I must say are quite awesome to work with!). An actual CMS, built on good development techniques, with decoupled reusable components and a plan to integrate as much as possible. To me, this is only a good thing.</p>

<p>Others, however, disagree with me. <a href="http://www.jenlampton.com/blog/introducing-backdrop-cms-drupal-fork">Backdrop</a> is a planned fork of Drupal, specifically to shun this upcoming change, to keep the old architecture and get rid of “best practices” that Drupal is trying to embrace. Now, I can totally get <em>why</em> they’d want to do this: Drupal has a huge entrenched user base, and to be honest, it’s mostly made up of fly-by-nighters who know enough PHP, HTML and JavaScript to be dangerous. These people are what have made Drupal’s conquering of the PHP CMS world possible… but are they the correct target market?</p>

<p>I can completely understand why the fork is considered needed – throwing away all the knowledge that this group of people have obtained seems crazy. There is value in a supremely stable API (look at large projects to get an idea of that), but I can’t help but wonder whether it’s such a good thing to be tied to an API and way of thinking that is years outdated, and will only hold Drupal back moving into the future? I think it may be better for this short-term pain, for some serious long-term gain.</p>

<p>I feel that those who are freaking out about throwing away all their hard work learning how to program Drupal as “non-developers” are right to be upset, but I also feel like it’s entirely the right move for Drupal to go down. Those who are worried can at least rest assured that Drupal 7 will continue to work for the forseeable future; but I implore them to get comfortable with Drupal 8.</p>

<p>Drupal 8’s move to a sane, well-planned architecture will reward those who take the time to learn it far more than Drupal 7 ever will. The concepts may seem foreign to those who aren’t traditional software engineers, but these concepts exist for a reason; frankly, I feel like those “not-a-devs” will be able to learn the new system <em>far faster</em> than they ever learnt Drupal 7’s mishmash of ideas.</p>

<p>With Drupal 8, I think that the pain involved will lose them some users. This is unavoidable. If you’re one of those users, just hold on – give it a try before you write it off. You’ll not only be learning skills that are transferable far outside of Drupal, but I’m certain you’ll find that this will be one of the final times you’ll have to go through this with Drupal.</p>

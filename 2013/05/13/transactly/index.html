<h2 id="what_is_it">What Is It?</h2>

<p>Transactly will be an online personal finance application, that tracks what you spend, what your bills are, how much it all costs and when. Using this info, it will automatically create and adjust a savings plan on the fly, based on your spending and saving habits.</p>

<p>Want to go on a holiday, but are terrible at saving? No problem, Transactly will tell you exactly how much you <em>can</em> spend each day, and how much needs to go into your bank.</p>

<p>It will also intelligently give you tips on what parts of your life you could save money on, from cutting down on your thrice-daily coffee, to looking at a more consistent phone plan (if you have a habit of going over!).</p>

<p>TECH DETAILS AHEAD: The plan is to create this as an online SaaS (software as a service) with an accompanying mobile application for ease of input for transaction details on the fly. It will use statistical data analysis (and perhaps machine learning, although I know very little about that!) for the “artificial intelligence”.</p>

<h2 id="the_mvp">The MVP</h2>

<p>As per Steve Blank’s “Lean Startup” method, a “Minimum Viable Product” would be the best way of deciding whether the market is ready (or willing) for such a product. It is the quickest way to see if an idea will fail, and due to having to try and make this work in my current geographical area not known for it’s startup scene (Brisbane, Australia), it’s something that I want to try.</p>

<p>So, the plan is this: I will build a simple front-end to show transactional data in a calendar-based format. The data it will show will be manually input by myself for the first few customers. The analysis for future earnings and spendings will be done by “hand” in Excel.</p>

<p>Here’s the kicker though: those first few (say, 5 to 10, although even 1 will be great) customers are going to have to <em>pay</em> for the service. I’m unsure what business model is the right one for Transactly, but that’s something I’m going to have to find out. I’m thinking less than a cup of coffee per week: $10 a month will be a great start. Let’s call it $9.95, everyone loves the smaller number.</p>

<h2 id="where_to_from_here">Where To From Here?</h2>

<p>Well, that’s for the future, isn’t it. First things first: build what is needed for the MVP, and start testing the market. In addition: time to find out what the competitor space is like. I’m going up against the <em>Big Boys</em> here: Mint, Quicken, etc. Will the “smart” analysis be the kicker? How much can I automate? How much friction can I remove from the personal finance process? Let’s find out.</p>
